How does spatial beta diversity change over time?

Root data file to use for all of these analyses
distances_dissimilarities_allyears <- readRDS(here::here("output","distance_decay","distances_dissimilarities_allyears.rds"))

  Models:
  1. Dissimilarity versus time: Allow intercepts to vary
    - lmer(bray curtis ~ year + (1|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1|survey_unit)) #occurence
    - lmer(bray curtis ~ year + (1|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1|survey_unit)) #occurence
        
  2. Dissimilarity versus time: Allow intercepts and slopes to vary (possibly a GAM instead to allow for wiggles?)
    - lmer(bray curtis ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #occurence
    - lmer(bray curtis ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #occurence
        
  3. Distance decay slope: Allow intercepts  to vary
    - extract slope parameter for each year and survey (betapart::decay.model() --> b.slope)
    - lmer(b.slope(bray) ~ year + (1 + survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + survey_unit)) #occurence
    - lmer(b.slope(jaccard) ~ year + (1 + survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + survey_unit)) #occurence
        
  4. Distance decay slope: Allow intercepts and slopes to vary
    - extract slope parameter for each year and survey (betapart::decay.model() --> b.slope)
    - lmer(b.slope(bray) ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #occurence
    - lmer(b.slope(jaccard) ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #biomass
        - lmer(jaccard ~ year + (1 + year|survey_unit)) #occurence

      2. Random slopes (Bray Curtis ~ Year + (1+year|survey_unit) with confidence interval, vertically oriented by survet unit. How does cofficient vary by: number of years surveyed, etc. (Figure 3B in Dornelas 2014)

      3. Patterns vary over time (Zoom in on 2 longer time series, maybe EBS and ZA)
        - sensitivity of Bray Curtis ~ Year coefficent to duration of time series and which series you pick
        - compare distribution of coefficients for all possible sequences of 2, 5, 10 & 20 years
        - emphasize value of annual observations
        - similar to Fredston-Hermann 2020 Figure 4
              
      4. Bray Curtis ~ MinTemperature + MaxTemperature + MeanTemperature + SDTemperature (within region, not accross all regions) + Fishing + (1|year) + (1|survey_unit)
      
      5. Map? not sure what would make sense here, may be a waste of space
          Maybe alongside figure 2
      
      
      
      
      
Still to consider:
  - leave out pelagics?
  - Maybe, Zoom in  closer on one region to see what's actually causing changes? track species coming and/or going  (probs EBS makes semse here too)
