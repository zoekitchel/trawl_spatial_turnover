# trawl_spatial_turnover

Here, I will be using the trawl data to see if there have been changes in spatial turnover across regions through time. I will start with the northeast US, but then expand to all regions. 

Basic organization of the repo
* plots/: figures
* output/: files output by scripts that we want Git to track
* temp/: files output by scripts that we don't want Git to track
