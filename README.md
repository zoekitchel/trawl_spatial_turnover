Please contact [Z.J. Kitchel](https://www.zoekithcel.com/) with questions about this project. The results are partially reproducible from the scripts and data files that can be shared are either in this GitHub repository or (if they are too large) hosted on [OSF](https://osf.io/) (as described below). 

## Where do data come from?

We used of a number of datasets that are already publicly available and/or published with this project, in addition to some regional datasets that may be available upon request from data providers. These are fully described and cited in the manuscript, but we also list them here for ease of download, access, and attribution. 

* Publically available trawl data from [FISHGLOB](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data), a project to harmonize publicly available trawl survey records from federal agencies around the globe. The raw data files from FISHGLOB are too big to host on GitHub but they are available on [OSF](https://osf.io/).
* Some regions are unable to share trawl data publically. Data may be available on request from data provider. See Table S1 for contact information.
* Sea bottom temperature data from [SODA 3.3.2](http://www.soda.umd.edu/), an ocean reanalysis data product by the University of Maryland available beginning in 1980. 
* Sea surface temperature data from [OISST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst), a historical satellite temperature record from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration beginning in 1982.
* Historical fishing pressure estimates from [Sea Around Us](https://www.seaaroundus.org/).


## What's in this repository?

The repository is organized as follows:

* `data_prep_code` contains Rmd scripts to access (when possible) and prepare trawl, temperature, and fishing datasets.
* `analysis_code` contains Rmd scripts to run all dissimilarity analyses.
* `data` contains raw datasets obtained from other sources (described above).
* `output` contains outputs of scripts that filter, clean, summarize, or analyze data.
* `figures` contains image files generated by scripts for the main and supplemental figures.
* `tables` contains csv and Rds files generated by scripts for main and supplemental tables.
* `archive` includes a mismash of scripts,output, figures, and tables that were a part of project development, but do not directly connect to currently used scripts, outputs, figures, or tables. Viewer beware, these are very possibly **wrong**, broken and non-functional but mean something significant to the authors, and are therefore included because ZJK is a hoarder.

## What's not in the repository? 

The following files are too big to host on GitHub and are available on [OSF](https://osf.io/) only:

- The raw publically available FISHGLOB data (a slightly earlier version of the dataset described in [Maureaud et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2bcjw)), `FISHGLOB_public_v1.5_clean.csv`. This should be downloaded from [OSF](https://osf.io/) and moved to `raw-data` to reproduce analyses for public surveys only.
- Norway (Barents Sea) required a data update in September 2023. Therefore, Norway is excluded from `FISHGLOB_public_v1.5_clean.csv`, and Norway data can be found in `data` > `Norway_Sep2023` > `NOR-BTS_clean.RData`. This file can be merged (with care) with `FISHGLOB_public_v1.5_clean.csv`.

We did not host the raw SODA and OISST data on OSF because the source files are very large. The SODA sea bottom temperature data were downloaded from [http://www.soda.umd.edu/](http://www.soda.umd.edu/) (accessed May 28, 2023). The NOAA OISST data were downloaded from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/sea-surface-temperature-optimum-interpolation/ (accessed May 19, 2023). 

We respect that trawl survey data for some regions are not currently publically available. Therefore, we cannot share survey data for South Georgia,the Mediterranean, South Africa, Chile, Namibia, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, or New Zealand. This repository includes scripts that will prepare and process these data, but does not include raw data files for these regions. Table S1 lists data providers/corresponding authors for each region.

## In what order should things be run?

To reproduce the analysis, run these scripts in order:

1. `prep_survey_extent_nc.R` generates a netcdf file with the spatial footprints of trawl surveys used in the analysis, for merging with marine heatwave data. It also generates a .csv file with a "key" to translate the integer survey ID codes in the netcdf to their real names. This does not need to be re-run, but all the scripts below this should be re-run in order if the spatial footprints are updated.
1. `prep_trawl_data.R` takes the public trawl data records from version 1.5 of [FISHGLOB](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data) (see above note about downloading the data file from [OSF](https://osf.io/)), processes them into a standardized format with columns for survey, year, species, and CPUE in kg, and writes them out as .csv files in the `processed-data` folder. This was run on a computing server (see Notes below). If you skip this step, the rest of the code will still run, using processed data files hosted on GitHub. 
1. `prep_MHWs.R` merges those trawl records with the appropriate MHW and CTI data.
1. `temporal_beta_diversity.R` calculates interannual changes in richness and beta diversity (both total dissimilarity and individual components of nestedness and turnover for occurrence metrics and biomass gradient and balanced variation for biomass metrics).
1. `power_analysis.R` conducts a power analysis. This was run on a computing server (see Notes below) and if you download the output files from [OSF](https://osf.io/) (see above) you can skip this step.
1. `MHW_stats_and_figures_main_text.R` analyzes the data and makes figures and statistics for the main text. 
1. `MHW_stats_and_figures_supplement.Rmd` generates the SI tables as a PDF and writes out all the extended data figures. 

## Notes
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
* Software versions used in this analysis are captured by `renv` and listed [in the lockfile](....renv.lock). Here is [a summary of how renv works](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 
* Most of these analyses were run on a personal computer, and should be easy to reproduce, except `` and ``, which were conducted in R 3.6.0 on a machine with the following specifications: Windows Server 2019 2-Intel 6154 Xeon 3.0Ghz 18cores(36 threads) each 512 GB memory 6TB- SSD storage 18TB- HDD storage NVIDIA P4000 8Gb 10Gb ethernet
