This code is a supplemental script 2 for Kitchel et al. TITLE manuscript. Run after standardize_temp_space_2 for visual of years and cells that are excluded using 70% year 70% cell code.

- This project is a collaborative effort to describe changes in taxonomic composition  of fish communities around the world--as sampled by bottom trawl surveys.

- Code by Zoë J. Kitchel

SESSION INFO TO DO

```{r setup, include=F}
library(data.table)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)

```

Load plots
```{r}
#years
fishglob_exclude_years_plots <- readRDS(here::here("figures","standardization","fishglob_exclude_years_plots.Rds"))

#cells
fishglob_exclude_cells_plots <- readRDS(here::here("figures","standardization","fishglob_exclude_cells_plots.Rds"))
```


Plot years excluded
```{r fig-plot-years, fig.keep="all", fig.height=4, fig.cap=paste0("Number of tows per year used to standardize spatial footprint through time. Years highlighted in turquoise exluded because they sampled less than 70% of cells."), message = F, echo = F, warning = F}
for (i in c(1:45)) {
  cat('\n\n') 
print(fishglob_exclude_years_plots[[i]])
  cat('\n\n') 
}

```

Plot cells excluded

-Check EBS, GOA later which aren't printing for some reason
```{r fig-plot-cells, fig.keep="all", fig.height=4, fig.cap=paste0("Tow locations and hexagonal grid cells used to standardize spatial footprint through time. Cells highlighted in turquoise exluded because they were sampled in less than 70% of years after accounting for undersampled years (See previous bar plots)."), message = F, echo = F, warning = F}
for (i in c(1:16,18:20,22:45)){
  cat('\n\n')
  print(fishglob_exclude_cells_plots[[i]])
  cat('\n\n')
}

```
