This code is a supplemental script 2 for Kitchel et al.~TITLE manuscript. Run after standardize\_temp\_space\_2 for visual of years and cells that are excluded using 70\% year 70\% cell code.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This project is a collaborative effort to describe changes in taxonomic composition of fish communities around the world--as sampled by bottom trawl surveys.
